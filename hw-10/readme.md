# HW-10 RESPONSE

#### What I learned:
1. Functions and arrays seem like simple concepts on their own, but when I tried applying them together it was a bit overwhelming.
2. I'm way too slammed with homework and projects this week... Didn't get to this until today, and that's why I couldn't do anything cool. However, I managed to repurpose an old assignment with the assignment requirements.

### What I need to work on:
1. Somehow having for than 24 hours in a day.
2. I really need to find a place online that offers more examples of how this stuff works. It has to be out there. Dan Shiffman's tutorials are great, but I'm so new to this it's not enough.

### Process this week:
Like I said, I didn't get to this until this afternoon. Been really busy with other classes. I tried really hard to come up with something on my own, but ended up getting frustrated and just reused homework 8. The function part was easy. Don't really need to go into that too much. What was a little tricky was deciding what I could use in an array. I ended up just using several numbers for the circles. Not that cool, but it works. I had to put the actual numbers in for the width and height, since the arrays are happier with numbers. I'm a little disappointed in myself for this weeks assignment, but hopefully I can get caught up and back on track.
