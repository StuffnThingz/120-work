# HW-6 RESPONSE

Wow, that was a lot to take in. The math is makeing me nervous for some reason.
I guess I mostly had a hard time trying to come up with original ideas to use with
all this new info in a short period of time.

I found the random and map functions most interesting this week. Still haven't worked
out the kinks with the map function... For instance, I wanted to make my circles turn from blue to red with
mouseX, but just settled for them going from black to red. I tried to utilize them
contrain function but couldn't get it to do what I wanted. I wanted the spots to stay
within the boundries, but it was doing all kinds of weird stuff. I was kind of cool, I could
have just lied and said that's what I wanted it to do, but that's counter productive.

I wasn't able to answer anyone's issues this week, but it looks like a couple people
had the same concerns about meeting all the math requirements. It looked like someone else
had a similar problem with getting the map function to work with coloring a shape.
