# HW-5 RESPONSE

Not going to lie, I struggled with this week. I feel like I started to get the idea towards the end of my project, but I needed to get it done to move on to other homework. Anytime I see math I start freaking out.

I realized toward the end of my project that I could have used "var" to help build my sketch.  For some reason I thought it would be easier to make my sketch like we did last week, THEN animate it. I had to remember to translate certain points so they would rotate just how I wanted.  I was kind of confused about the global and local scope part. I just experimented with it until I got the result I wanted. At the end of my project I realized I needed something using the width and height feature, so I just added one of those mouse counters in the center.

I'm going to keep practicing the exercises in the book so I can get a better handle on this for next week. I think I just need to get an idea of what I'm going to do BEFORE I start doing it.
