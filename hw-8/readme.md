# HW-8 RESPONSE

#### What I learned:
1. My problem solving skills are garbage, but slowly getting better.
2. For loops are cool and can help save a lot of time.

### What I need to work on:
1. Everything. Wish I didn't have other classes to worry about.

### Process this week:
I spent a lot of time watching Dan Shiffman's tutorials. I originally wanted to make a growing circle that would change colors based on the size, then return to the center after it hit the borders. I figured out how to get the circle to grow, but couldn't figure the rest out. I also didn't know how I would work that into a for loop. It didn't seem practical for this assignment. I settled for a 4 panel grid with an ellipse in each square that would randomly change colors. I added in the keyISPressed thing just to make it more interesting. I also never used it before, so I just wanted to see if it would work. If I took one thing away from this week, it would be that loops help you make a lot of shapes with very little code.
