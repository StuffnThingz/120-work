# HW-11 RESPONSE

#### What I learned:
1. Classes make your code way cleaner.
2. Classes hurt my head. Lots of stuff to remember. I must have watched those Dan Shiffman tutorials a million times, and I still don't fully understand.

### What I need to work on:
1. I got my code to ALMOST do what I wanted it to do. Need to explore the mousePressed function with this Class stuff some more.
2. Not sure of the relationship between the class, array, setup, and draw. I looked in the book for some examples, but couldn't find much.

### Process this week:
I think the hardest thing for me was thinking of a simple idea I could build on. I started by just drawing an arrow, and figured it might be cool to make them shoot across the screen. I made two classes, move and show, for the arrow. That wasn't too hard to understand. I finally got 20 arrows to shoot across the screen with the mousePressed function. However, when you press the mouse again, the arrows start over. Couldn't figure that one out. I'm actually looking at my code right now still trying to figure out how all this stuff interacts and it's hurting my head. Overall, I think I made some progress this week and I'm starting to see how this stuff could be used to make simple games.
