# HW-4 RESPONSE

I spent a lot of time in front of the computer so far this week.  Lots of time
on youtube watching tutorials, checking the p5 reference page, and rewatching
the tutorials on the homepage.

I actually had to start over at one point because my computer died and the file was lost.  It was frustrating, but alowed me to start from scratch and get more experience. I posted about this in the issues board, but there wasn't much I can do.  I'll remember to back my work up better from here on out.

The thing I had trouble with the most on this assignment was translate and arc.  I just found it hard to keep track of what I translated from the last time.  I started translating for every "sandbox" I did so I could remember that I was translating from the centerpoint I started at the beginning. As far as the arc thing, I just experiemented until I got what I wanted.  I was starting to figure it out forwards the end.

I felt like a lot of this was just experimenting until you got the result you wanted. It was a fun project, minus losing my first attempt.  Look forward to learning more!
